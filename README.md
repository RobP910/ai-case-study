## Company Introduction

- Company Name and Location:
> ### [Palladyne AI](https://palladyneai.com/) formally known as [SARCOS](https://www.sarcos.com/) | Salt Lake City, UT

- When was the company incorporated?
> ### While the newly named 'Palladyne AI' has only recently been introduced to the World,[^1] 'SARCOS' has been around in one form or another since 1983.[^2]

- Who are the founders of the company?
> ### SARCOS was originally founded by the late [Stephen Jacobsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jacobsen). Ben Wolfe became CEO sometime between 2015 and 2016[^2] where he has spearheaded the rebranding that involved the name change from 'SARCOS Technology and Robotics Corp.' to 'Palladyne AI Corp.'

- How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
> ### The name change came about mostly thru necessity as the former SARCOS company was failing to meet most of its shareholders expectations. The new name reflects the company's newly narrowed focus on commercializing the artificial intelligence and machine learning software that it has been developing since 2020. [^1]

- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
> ### [Palladyne AI](https://palladyneai.com/) will be trading as NASDAQ:[PDYN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/watchlist?tab=Related&id=bzx4pr&ocid=ansMSNMoney11&duration=1Y&src=b_secdans&relatedQuoteId=bzx4pr&relatedSource=MlAl) effective April 8th, 2024.[^1] They currently have just under $40M in cash.[^1]

## Business Activities

- What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
> ### Palladyne AI plans to significantly reduce the time and effort it takes to program and deploy robots.

- Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
### &nbsp; Palladyne AI believes its software has wide application in industries such as:
|             Industry               |             Industry               |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| automotive                         | aviation                           |
| construction                       | defense                            |
| general manufacturing              | infrastructure inspection          |
| logistics                          | warehousing                        |

### &nbsp; And non-traditional applications such as:
|           Applications             |           Applications             |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs)     | Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)    |
| Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)  |                                    |

## Results

- What has been the business impact of this company so far?
> ### I believe it's too soon to tell, but definitely one to watch. You could take away from the companies history that they don't have the team to be successful. As a formal employee, I have not been aware of any philosophical changes in upper management that would lead to the success of Palladyne AI.

- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
> ### This isn't exactly a direct comparison, more like comparing apples and oranges, but watching videos of the [![SARCOS Guardian (r) XO](https://youtu.be/PZcHlz_obyw?t=87)](https://youtu.be/PZcHlz_obyw) vs. [![Boston Dynamics Atlas]()](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SFKM-Rxiqzg?feature=share) you can see where Palladyne AI may help in both of these endeavors.

## Recommendations

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
> ### I've always been a proponent of helping those that can't get around very well. I suspect a very lightweight version of the Guardian XO can help people walk. Or a wheeled version helps employ those already in a wheelchair, making them marketable in job markets that they normally wouldn't be a viable candidate in.

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
> ### I believe that AI technology has the potential to enhance exoskeletons, creating additional opportunities for individuals who may otherwise be unable to fulfill certain positions due to disabilities. And by helping to reduce the risk of injury to a minimum, AI-powered exoskeletons can enable greater accessibility and inclusivity in various roles and industries.
